# ü©∫ Diabetes Management System Using Smartwatches and AI

## Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive **Diabetes Management System** that leverages smartwatches, Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs), and AI-powered chatbots to deliver **personalized insights and support** to diabetic patients. The system utilizes **ClinicalBERT**, **XGBoost**, and **Diabetica7B** integrated with **Reinforcement Learning** to analyze health data, predict risks, and provide tailored health reports and recommendations.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Smartwatch Integration**  
  Collects real-time data on vital signs, activity, and glucose levels.
  
- **Predictive Analytics**  
  Uses **XGBoost** to forecast glucose trends and hypoglycemia risks.
  
- **Personalized Reporting**  
  Generates detailed, patient-specific reports using **Diabetica7B**, enhanced via reinforcement learning.
  
- **Chatbot Interaction**  
  Offers friendly, adaptive communication, tailored to each patient‚Äôs needs and preferences.

---

## üß† Technologies Used
- **ClinicalBERT**  
  BERT model fine-tuned on clinical notes for understanding medical text.
  
- **XGBoost**  
  Gradient boosting framework for robust predictive analytics.
  
- **Diabetica7B**  
  Specialized LLM for diabetes-focused report generation and interaction.

- **Front end**
  Next.js and React.js

- **Backend**
  Node.js and Express.js
  
- **Reinforcement Learning**  
  Optimizes chatbot responses based on real-time user feedback.

## üîÑ System Integration and Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Smartwatch + CGM collect vital signs, activity, and glucose levels in real-time.
   
2. **Data Processing**  
   XGBoost performs risk prediction; ClinicalBERT processes clinical/note-based text.
   
3. **Chatbot Interaction**  
   Diabetica7B delivers custom reports and advice, refined by reinforcement learning.
   
4. **Personalization**  
   Learns patient-specific needs and provides actionable recommendations.
